It can be useful for taking notes wherever you want at any time, it is portable i.e. it does not require installation so you can use it anywhere and without necessarily installing something you are not interested in on a PC that may not be yours and therefore you do not need to install your things. ..

It is small but is useful every day in many areas to keep in the background while you are working so as to always have it at hand to be able to take notes of any kind.

You can write lists and modify, delete both temporarily and permanently, you can also save the list to be able to look at it in a different file and print it... it does whatever you want, I've now created it ;D

In the section of my website https://www.accybertech.it/task-list-app/ you will find everything you need regarding documentation etc...
If you have any suggestions, do not hesitate to contact me via my email acybertech@outlook.it.
